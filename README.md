# Security Policy Assessment Toolkit (Policy Gap Analysis)

##  Overview
This toolkit is designed to help organizations assess their existing security policies for gaps, weaknesses, and alignment with industry frameworks such as NIST, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls. It demonstrates the kind of policy analysis and reporting I perform as part of GRC consulting engagements.

> This repository presents **structure and strategy**, but intentionally does not include full proprietary templates or playbooks to preserve client value and encourage direct engagement.

##  Objectives
